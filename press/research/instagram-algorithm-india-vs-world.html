            <p class="location-date">Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, India – September 29, 2025 | An independent study by <strong>Jaydatt
                    Khodave</strong>, Team Leader at <strong>Supreme X</strong>, reveals notable differences in how
                Instagram’s recommendation algorithm serves content to users in India versus the United States, Japan
                and the United Kingdom. The research used nine newly created Instagram accounts from multiple countries
                to compare feed behaviour over time.
            </p>

            <h2>The Experiment Setup</h2>
            <p>
                To reduce bias, accounts were created using <em>GoLogin Anti Detect Browser</em> to simulate distinct
                devices and IP addresses. Each account had varied gender, date of birth and initial interests to observe
                how Instagram builds personalised feeds.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5 accounts</strong> from India</li>
                <li><strong>2 accounts</strong> from the United States</li>
                <li><strong>1 account</strong> from Japan</li>
                <li><strong>1 account</strong> from the United Kingdom</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings from India</h2>

            <h3>Account 1 (Male, India)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Initially shown traditional and cultural content (for example: Ram Charan, NTR, Dhanush).</li>
                <li>Within <strong>30–40 minutes</strong>, the feed shifted to vulgar, objectionable and explicit
                    videos.</li>
                <li>Even after reporting, the platform continued to recommend similar content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accounts 2 &amp; 3 (Female, India)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Started with lifestyle and skin-care content.</li>
                <li>Gradually shifted to mixed reels including foreign male lifestyle content that did not match initial
                    interests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Account 4 (Female, India; DOB set as 25)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Algorithm began pushing romantic, suggestive and relationship-driven reels.</li>
                <li>Content became more emotional and manipulative in tone.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="observation">
                <strong>Observation:</strong> Indian accounts consistently received higher levels of vulgar and
                manipulative content regardless of gender, age or initial interests.
            </p>

            <h2>Findings from the United States</h2>

            <h3>US Account 1 (Female, 20 years)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Feed emphasised luxury lifestyle, motivational guidance and family values.</li>
                <li>No vulgar or objectionable material observed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>US Account 2 (Male)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Content concentrated on entrepreneurship, success stories and educational reels.</li>
                <li>Vulgar content was minimal — approximately 1 in 100 posts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings from Japan</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeds showed traditional, cultural and tech-driven videos.</li>
                <li>Strong focus on education, innovation and positive values.</li>
                <li>No manipulative or vulgar content was pushed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings from the United Kingdom</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeds displayed light entertainment, prank-style videos and harmless humour.</li>
                <li>Very little vulgarity compared to India.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>India vs. other countries:</strong> The algorithm appears to promote vulgar, suggestive and
                    manipulative content more heavily in India than in the US, Japan or the UK.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural manipulation?:</strong> Despite initial preferences and reporting, Indian accounts
                    experienced unavoidable pushes of explicit content.</li>
                <li><strong>Youth impact:</strong> These patterns raise concerns about whether social media is
                    influencing the mindset of India’s young generation in ways that may conflict with social and
                    cultural values.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                “When the same platform behaves differently in India and abroad, it clearly shows that the algorithm is
                not neutral. While users in the US or Japan are being guided towards growth, education and positivity,
                Indian youth are being bombarded with vulgarity and manipulative trends. This is not just unfair—it is
                dangerous,” said <strong>Jaydatt Khodave</strong>, Team Leader at Supreme X.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                India is one of Instagram’s largest markets, with millions of young users online daily. The study points
                to possible algorithmic bias that shapes the digital experience in India differently, calling for urgent
                dialogue on <strong>digital ethics, content responsibility and algorithmic transparency</strong> from
                global social media platforms.
